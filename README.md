# viewHQ
A little, websockets-based Flask application that let's me change rendered views from a single control 'view HQ' of sorts. This is mainly a testing ground for a different application.

### Python Requirements
* Python 3 (currently I am using v3.6.5 (which is the latest version (because I use Arch+)), although this should work on any 3.x)
* Redis
* Flask
* Flask-SocketsIO

### Rock On

### License?
For once, I am putting this code in the public domain. Have fun.
